Thoughts for process_sign_out route.

1.  Get an active _id from web client form.
  a.  It would need to send a POST request to a route that does some pretty
      top level work, basically managing this whole workflow.
    - This needs to be built slowly, tested along the way and documented with
      comments.
      1.  SO FIRST, I'M GOING TO SET UP A BASIC POST THAT JUST CONSOLE
          LOGS FROM THE AJAX REQUEST.
  b.  The web client needs to send two pieces of data to the server.
    - the _id, so I can lookup the sign in on the db.
    - the timestamp out, so I can calculate how many hours go on the clock.
2.  Use the timestamp to calculate how many hours go on the clock.
    - this would be a utils.py function that takes in time and out time.
3.  Perform an update on the cast member item from database.
4.  Delete the active_id from the server side database.
